Minimal plugin that allows WordPress users to log in using Google.
 
== Description ==

Minimal plugin that allows WordPress users to log in using Google.

= Setup =

1. Create a project from [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard) if none exists.
2. Go to **Credentials** tab, then create credential for OAuth client.
    * Application type will be **Web Application**
    * Add `YOUR_DOMAIN/wp-login.php` in **Authorized redirect URIs**
3. This will give you **Client ID** and **Secret key**.
4. Input these values either in `WP Admin > Settings > WP Google Login`, or in `wp-config.php` using the following code snippet:

`
define( 'WP_GOOGLE_LOGIN_CLIENT_ID', 'YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID' );
define( 'WP_GOOGLE_LOGIN_SECRET', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY' );
`

= How to enable automatic user registration =

You can enable user registration either by
- Checking `Settings > WP Google Login > Enable Google Login Registration`
OR
- Adding `define( 'WP_GOOGLE_LOGIN_USER_REGISTRATION', 'true' );` in wp-config.php file.

Note: If the checkbox is ON then, it will register valid Google users even when WordPress default setting, under `Settings > General Settings > Membership > Anyone can register` checkbox is OFF.

= How to restrict user registration to one or more domain(s) =

By default, when you enable user registration via constant `WP_GOOGLE_LOGIN_USER_REGISTRATION` or enable `Settings > WP Google Login > Enable Google Login Registration`, it will create a user for any Google login (including gmail.com users). If you are planning to use this plugin on a private, internal site, then you may like to restrict user registration to users under a single Google Suite organization. This configuration variable does that.

Add your domain name, without any schema prefix and `www,` as the value of `WP_GOOGLE_LOGIN_WHITELIST_DOMAINS` constant or in the settings `Settings > WP Google Login > Whitelisted Domains`. You can whitelist multiple domains. Please separate domains with commas. See the below example to know how to do it via constants:

`define( 'WP_GOOGLE_LOGIN_WHITELIST_DOMAINS', 'example.com,sample.com' );`

**Note:** If a user already exists, they **will be allowed to login with Google** regardless of whether their domain is whitelisted or not. Whitelisting will only prevent users from **registering** with email addresses from non-whitelisted domains.

= Hooks =

Action `wp_google_login_token`
This action provides access token received after Google login.  
**Parameters:**

* `token` (Array): Converted token using `fetchAccessTokenWithAuthCode` method of `Google_Client` class.
* `user_info` (Array): Details of user after login.
* `client` (Object): `Google_Client` object in use.

Filter `wp_google_login_scopes`
This filter can be used to filter existing scope used in Google Sign in.
You can ask for additional permission while user logs in.
This filter will provide 1 parameter `scopes` in callback, which contains array of scopes.

= wp-config.php parameters list =

* `WP_GOOGLE_LOGIN_CLIENT_ID` (string): Google client ID of your application.
* `WP_GOOGLE_LOGIN_SECRET` (string): Secret key of your application
* `WP_GOOGLE_LOGIN_USER_REGISTRATION` (boolean) (optional): Set `true` If you want to enable new user registration. By default, user registration defers to `Settings > General Settings > Membership` if constant is not set.
* `WP_GOOGLE_LOGIN_WHITELIST_DOMAINS` (string) (optional): Domain names, if you want to restrict login with your custom domain. By default, it will allow all domains. You can whitelist multiple domains.
