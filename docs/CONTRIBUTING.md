- **Always create a feature or bug fix branch** instead of committing directly to `develop`.
- **Keep PRs small and focused on the GitHub issue it resolves**, making them easier to review.
- **Write meaningful commit messages** describing what changed and why.
- **Sync `develop` regularly** to stay updated with the latest changes.
- **Delete merged branches** to keep the repository clean.
